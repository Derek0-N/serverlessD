# Azure Serverless Function: Hello World

This project demonstrates the implementation of a scalable, serverless architecture using Azure Functions. It features a simple HTTP-triggered function that responds with a "Hello, World!" message, showcasing the power and simplicity of serverless computing in the Azure cloud environment. Built with Node.js and leveraging the Azure Functions Core Tools, this application serves as a foundation for developing more complex, event-driven microservices. It highlights key benefits of serverless architecture including automatic scaling, reduced operational overhead, and a pay-per-execution cost model. This project is ideal for developers looking to explore cloud-native development, optimize resource utilization, and accelerate time-to-market for their applications.
